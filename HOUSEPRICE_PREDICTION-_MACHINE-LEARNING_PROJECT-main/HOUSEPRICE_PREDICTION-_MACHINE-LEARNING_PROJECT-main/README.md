🏠 House Price Prediction Project Overview
**🎯 Objective: Predict the price of houses based on features like size, location, and more.

**📊 Data Collection:

Gather data from real estate listings or public databases.
Typical features include:
Size 📏 (square footage)
Location 🌍 (zip code, neighborhood)
Number of Bedrooms 🛏️
Number of Bathrooms 🚿
Year Built 🗓️
Type of Property 🏡 (single-family, condo)
**🧹 Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning 🧼: Fix missing values and outliers.
Encoding 🔢: Convert categorical data (like location) into numbers.
Normalization ⚖️: Scale features to ensure they're on a similar scale.
**🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize 📈: Use graphs to see patterns and relationships.
Analyze 🔎: Look for trends and correlations between features and prices.
**🧪 Feature Selection:

Choose Important Features 🔍: Determine which features are most relevant for predicting prices.
**📈 Model Building:

Select Algorithms 🤖: Options include Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, etc.
Train the Model 🏋️: Fit the model using your training data.
Evaluate Performance 🏆: Use metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or R-squared to assess how well the model works.
**🔄 Model Tuning:

Optimize ⚙️: Adjust hyperparameters to improve performance.
**📝 Prediction:

Make Predictions 🔮: Use the trained model to estimate prices for new data.
**📊 Results and Visualization:

Present Findings 📊: Show how the model's predictions compare to actual prices using charts and graphs.
**🔍 Conclusion:

Summarize 📝: Highlight key insights and suggest improvements for future work.
